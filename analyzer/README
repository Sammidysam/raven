Sentiment Analysis Algorithm
-Parses through a Tweet and formulates a numeric favorability rating based on keywords in that tweet and various other factors

FACTORS
Keywords - Words in the tweet that have definite +/- value

Account Lean - The identifying lean of the account making the tweet. If we considered the political left to be negatie numbers (left of 0) then the lean rating of NPR would be something like -5, while FOX's lean rating would be somehting like 5

Other things to consider/implement

Sarcasm, repeat words, comedians, news organizations, comments, retweets&likes as a multiplier, the person speaking about themself, quotes around word (to indicate sarcasm), nicknames

Structure

The analyzer will read in a tweet and, for each word in the tweet, see if the word belongs to a positive or negative "bucket" of words and adjust the favoribility rating accordingly

nwords - a set of negative words and their impact
gwords - a set of positive words and their impact

there isnt a set for neutral words because it would be faster to just analyze the words that will affect the rating than to recognize words that wont
